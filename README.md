In this assignment we created a daily planner.
We did so by appending columns and rows via .js (\$[i]-jquery) to the container in our html
There are 9 columns, corresponding to the workday
The top of the page presents the user with the current date (using momemt)
They can input a list of things to do for each hour, and that user input is stored in local storage,
so when the page is reloaded their 'TODOS' are still there
When the user clicks the save button, this is when their input is stored in local storage
The time blocks also change color, depending on if it is past, future, or present (using moment)
We also used 'liner-gradient' in our css for the background color of the header (which I thought was pretty cool)
